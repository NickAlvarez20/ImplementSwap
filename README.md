## Project Name
Implement Swap
## About
The Implement Swap project demonstrates a basic swap function in JavaScript for exchanging elements in an array using a temporary variable. It includes test cases with assertions to verify correctness, ideal for educational purposes in environments like CodeHS that support println and Program.assertEqual.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need JavaScript installed on your system (e.g., via a browser console or Node.js with adaptations).
No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This Implement Swap includes these features:

-A reusable swap function for array elements at specified indices

-Test array initialization and multiple swap operations

-Assertion-based validation and output printing for verification

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/ImplementSwap.git`
## Usage
Copy the JavaScript code into a compatible environment (e.g., CodeHS or a browser console; adapt println to console.log and implement Program.assertEqual for Node.js):
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Master array indexing and mutation in JavaScript

-Implement classic swap logic using a temporary variable

-Use assertions for testing and validating code behavior
